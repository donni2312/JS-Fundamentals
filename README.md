# MY FIRST JS CODEðŸŽˆ

As part of my journey at ALX doing front-end development, I have starting learning JavaScript from scratch and this is the first repo Js I have made.

#### In this repo, I have:âš¡
- created a constant variable called myVar with the value â€œJavaScript is amazing."
- used console.log(...) to print all output in the console.

Following upgrades in Js, i was restricted from using var as current websites are prone to errors if var is used.

### Viewing the ProjectðŸ”‘
- To view, download node.js from their website: nodejs.org and follow the documentation to have it installed into your computer.
- From then, you can run the file from the terminal using: node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js to view the output.
